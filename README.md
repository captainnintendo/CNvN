# What is CNvN?
*CNvN: The Rise of CHAOS* is a free (forever) fangame based on the characters of Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon.
This is a fanmade product and I do not intend to infringe copyright nor make money off of it. It is not affiliated with WarnerMedia or ViacomCBS. It uses Godot.

## Plot
When an evil emperor named Chaos enslaves the multiverse and plans to suck it into the Void, it's up to CN & Nick characters, reimagined in a new style, to team up and defeat Chaos and the foes he's teamed up with!

## When will it release?
Development has started since March 12, 2020, and it has no set release date yet.
